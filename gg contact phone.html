                        We at Gruendell Gardening would like to thank you for taking an interest in our company and supporting
                        the small businesses of Utah. We offer a full range of landscaping that includes, but is not
                        limited to <a href="gg lush gardens.html">designing and planting</a>. All of our designs are one of a kind and
                        custom tailored to your property. We plant only the highest quality of plants we can find. Everything from trees and shrubs to annuals and perennials. All color coordinated and leveled to perfection for your veiwing pleasure.<br><br>

                        We also offer the laying of <a href="gg pathways.html">pathways</a> made from brick, stone, boulders and more. Our flagstones are hand selected for beauty and flawlessness. Pieced together for accents that will tie your landscape together perfectly. Other ideas you may want to consider with our stone laying, is rock patios. Made with the same quality flagstones as our paths and leveled to create an oasis for relaxation and social events.
                        <br><br>

                        Furthermore we strive for beauty, even when there isnt much to work with at the start. We can create <a href="gg rockwalls.html">rock retaining walls</a> for a stand alone garden. Also we can add to pre-existing retaining walls to make them even more beautiful. Perhaps just a few sunset colored boulders to accent a highlighted area in your gardens.<br><br> 

                        We also offer lawn care services that include seasonal upkeep of your lawns. We will mow, edge, trim and fertilize your yard to excellence. If you don't have a lawn right now, we can lay fresh sod or seed and install and/or repair an automatic sprinkler system. Furthermore, we offer maintenance for your gardens to keep them gorgeous year round including Spring and Fall cleanups.<br><br>

                        Finally for the Winter season we can still help by offering snow removal services. We start at 4:00am on snow days to clear your driveway and walkways. We offer all of these services to residential and busi
